    <h2>An amazing journey to software development</h2>
        <h3>How can you be a global software engineer?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Nothing is impossible for a passionate and hard working person on this earth. I would like to tell you my story of becoming a software developer. From my childhood, I was curious about how websites  are constructed and got a wish to own mine. Unfortunetely,I did not get the opportunity to explore in the field that I could have fetched skills of building websites. In secondary school, I studied mathematics ,physics and geography where it was rare to meet with computers and I did not own one. Later in university I continued with electronics and telecommunication where I was supposed to dedicate my time on related courses of the above mentioned field.</p>

    <h3>Passion leads to involvement</h3>
      <p>After the completion of university studies, I got a professional internship in a company where I spent most of the time time out of the office with duties like building and installing base transceiver stations countrywide. However,for the little time in office, I was with software developers in the same room. They inspired me in the way they worked as a team, the way they analyzed the project to find the final solution,the way they collaborated and the way they achieved their goals that pushed me to join the software development field in order to accomplish the curiosity from childhood. I started to get some pieces of information on software development,where I approached some friends to learn how to use a simple html file and they did this by giving me basic tasks.</p>
     <h3>Passion into Action</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Finally, I have got an opportunity to join a globally known organization in software programming, Andela Rwanda. It was an amazing opportunity to fetch all skills of software development. My short term and long term goals is to become a global full stack software engineer so that I can influence local and international advanced web technology.  It is better to set flexible and understandable goals in order to achieve a fixed target. It is not only working hard all day and night but also communicating effectively with the professionals that will help me to reach high in software development.</p>
